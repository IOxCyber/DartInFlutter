/*
1.Nested functions are functions defined within another function. When we create functions within 
main() we are taking advantage of nested functions as main() is a function on its own.
2.We are declaring a function outerFunction which is printing the statement Outer Function. 
The function body of outerFunction also contains a function declaration 
for nestedFunction. nestedFunction prints the statement Nested Function.
3.The function body of outerFunction ends with a function call to nestedFunction.
In main(), we are calling outerFunction, which prints both statements.
If we called nestedFunction in main() rather than outerFunction,
we would get an error as nestedFunction is outside the scope of main().
